## Introduction

This Chess Engine uses the Minimax algorithm, a decision-making algorithm used for decision making in turn-based games. The algorithm works by simulating all possible game scenarios a few steps ahead and then making an optimal decision based on the simulation's outcome.

## Technologies

Project is created with:

* JavaScript ES6

## Setup

To run this project, install it locally, download the project -> unzip it and run in your browser

## Features

* Real-time chess simulation with a computer player
* Decision-making powered by the Minimax algorithm
* Easy setup and execution
* Adjustable difficulty levels

## Usage

The chess engine is started with the command:

$ npm start


This will start a game between the user and the computer player. The user makes moves by entering the start and end squares in algebraic notation. The computer player uses the Minimax algorithm to decide its moves.
